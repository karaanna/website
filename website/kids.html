  <p> I will start out with introducing my kids. We have a blended family of 4 kids, I have two boys and one girl, Ian has one girl, together we have one due August 2019. Starting with our oldest M (Juney), he is 12 ending of August this year. Next, is my girl R(Oocha), she turned 10 back in March. J(JJ) just turned 10 on Canada Day, she is just 3 months younger than Oocha. Samuel, my youngest is 5 and a half. Our child together remains a surprise for the delivery room.
