<p>Hello there! Thanks for joining me on my blogging journey. My name is Kara-Anna Adams and I live on Vancouver Island in BC Canada. I am a mother of 4 with one more child on the way. I have an amazing partner Ian, who supports me and the kids wholeheartedly in all that we do. We couldnt have asked for a better guy for our family. In this blog site you will find my thoughts on parenting, running the house and everything inbetween that comes with this crazy journey. Things can get a little chaotic around here with so many kids, but we take pride in running things quite smoothly for the most part and here is where you will find out how we do it. Routines, communication tips, raising resilient and respectful kids and activities we do with them to keep them busy is some of the content I will cover.</p>
